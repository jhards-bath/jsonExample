# jsonExample


{description: 'e.g. add x + y', A: 'option1', B: 'option2', C: 'option3', D: 'option4', correct: 'A'},

The part before the 'text' is the key and the part inside '' is the data. We only need to change the data.

Add each entry between the square brackets [] and include a comma between them. The last entry doesn't need a comma at the end of it.
